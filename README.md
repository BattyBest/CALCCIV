# CALCCIV
A port of FreeCiv to the Ti 84 Plus Color Edition graphing calculator.

# What does it do?
Not a lot, currently. This project is still in its infancy.
It has a map, a new game creation screen, and a terrain viewer.

# Where do I submit features?
There should be a post on Cemetech, go there. (https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=303009#303009)
Alternatively, open an issue here on GitHub.

# Installation Instructions
1. Download all three files
2. Transfer them to your calculator (TI Connect CE or TiLP is recommended)
3. Run GDSTAND once OR if your ram gets reset OR if GDB9 is tampered with in any way shape or form
4. Open CalcCiv

# Usage/Keybinds

- \[Arrow Keys\] Moves the cursor, practically always
- \[Clear\] Quit if in game, or, cancels unit movement
- \[y=\] Redraw screen
- \[Trace\] Reload screen
